            <h4>Yummy Yummy Chicken Wings</h4>
            <p>For crispy chicken wings, preheat your oven to 400째F (200째C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Pat 2 lbs of chicken wings dry, then toss them in olive oil, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt, pepper, cayenne pepper (optional), and baking powder for extra crispiness. Arrange the wings in a single layer on the sheet or a wire rack and bake for 25-30 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden and crispy.</p>
            <p>Once the wings are done, toss them in your favorite sauce like buffalo, BBQ, or honey garlic if desired. Serve immediately with dipping sauce on the side and enjoy your crispy, flavorful wings!</p>
