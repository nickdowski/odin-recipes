            <p>Milk steak, inspired by It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, is a hilarious and absurd creation that Charlie Kelly orders on the show. Though it’s presented as an outlandish dish in the episode, the concept of steak marinated and served with milk gives us the opportunity to play around with flavors. By soaking the steak in milk and pairing it with a creamy gravy, we get a fun and absurd twist on a classic steak dinner, without straying too far into weirdness.</p>
            <p>The result is a tender, juicy steak with a rich, milky gravy that complements the beef's flavors. While this recipe might not be exactly what Charlie had in mind, it's a delicious and humorous homage to the show’s offbeat sense of humor. Perfect for a fan of It's Always Sunny, this version of milk steak brings a bit of fun to your dinner table while still being tasty and satisfying.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul class="ingredients">
                <li>2 bone-in ribeye steaks (or your preferred cut of steak)</li>
                <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
                <li>A pinch of nutmeg (optional, for a fun twist)</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Marinate the steak: Place the steaks in a shallow dish and pour the milk over them. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven: Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
                <li>Season the steak: Remove the steaks from the milk and pat them dry with paper towels. Season both sides with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and nutmeg if using.</li>
                <li>Sear the steak: In an oven-safe skillet, heat the olive oil over high heat. Sear the steaks for 2-3 minutes on each side until browned.</li>
                <li>Finish in the oven: Transfer the skillet to the oven and cook the steaks for an additional 5-10 minutes, depending on your desired level of doneness.</li>
                <li>Rest and serve: Remove the steaks from the oven and let them rest for a few minutes before slicing. Serve with a creamy gravy made from the pan drippings and butter.</li>
            </ol>
